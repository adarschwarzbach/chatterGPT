The GPT-Based Audio Assistant is an advanced application that combines voice recognition, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and audio playback to create an interactive experience. Users can input a command or question via audio, the application transcribes this audio to text, processes the input with OpenAI's GPT model, and then outputs the response in audio format.
